This Project is my Dissertation Project for Year 3 of Computer Science at Newcastle University. The program is intended to be a technical demonstration, and therefore not a complete game. Bugs are present and there are no menus.

The idea of the game is to have each object running in parallel. Each object is possessed and updated by an individual thread, and rendered in the main thread.

All work found herein is property of Matthew Thomson. You are permitted to download and change the code as you wish, but all credit belongs to the owner.

To fork this repo you will need the following libraries:

Glew
sfml 2.1
soil

The libraries must be in the same directory as the repo in order to run correctly.
